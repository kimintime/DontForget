# Don’t Forget!
*Welcome to the Don’t Forget simple to-do list. This is just a simple webpage to-do list with the following features:*

* The user can include as little or as much as they choose, including date and type of task.
* The date field has a date selector. The user may track past tasks, for example, to track what has already been completed.
* The user doesn’t have to click buttons to enter tasks.
* The user must enter at least one character in the description field, though.
* The date and type fields are hidden from view.
* Items entered into the list can be deleted, and undeleted.
* Items can be removed from the list for editing by the user.
* The list keeps track of total and completed tasks.
* Tasks can be sorted by showing and hiding completed tasks.
* The webpage saves all tasks and the counter status.
* The user can choose to delete all saved tasks.

## How to Use
* Simply type in the field marked “Add your to-do here…”, then either hit enter, click ‘Add’, or click the ‘More’ button for more options.
	* More options gives the user the option to add either date and/or a category.  This is solely up to choice, but the user must enter something in the main description field.  Either ‘Add’ button will work, as well as hitting the return key on your keyboard. Those buttons are there for convenience. 
* Tasks entered into the list can be checked-through as completed, and also individually deleted.
* If the user changes their mind about what they deleted, the ‘Edit’ menu next to the main description field has an ‘Undo Delete’ option that will bring the task back to the list, and update the counter at the bottom accordingly.
	* The ‘Edit’ menu also allows the user to recall the last task entered, for easy editing. 
	* Additionally, the ‘Edit’ menu has an option for the user to manually save data, but the page should be doing that itself. ‘Delete All’ clears the page of all tasks.
* Below the list of tasks is a box where the count of completed and total tasks are tallied, as well as buttons to sort the tasks.
	* ‘Hide Completed’ will hide tasks marked as done, and ‘Show Completed’ shows only those tasks that are done. ‘Show All’ shows all tasks.
		* If it’s not displaying what the user would like, there are two options. Either simply click ‘Show All’, or select ‘Undo Delete’ from the ‘Edit’ dropdown menu.

## Wish List - Evaluation
* The ability to sort the table would be handy, but most online help points me to JQuery.
* Drag and drop would also be nice, but it’s beyond me at the present stage, maybe if there’s a next version.
* There’s way more talented people than myself in this course. I took only basic java ages ago, and HTML is new to me still. I worked way beyond the scope of five credit hours, burned the candle at both ends, and it still feels incomplete without drag and drop and table sorting. 
* On the other hand, the only bit of code I really copied was listening to the enter key, and I can look at it and understand what it’s doing at least. The HTML and CSS is all valid, and I achieved every point on list, but for drag and drop.
* The javascript is all commented, please see there for more.
